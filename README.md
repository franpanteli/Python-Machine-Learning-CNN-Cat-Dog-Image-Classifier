# Python-Machine-Learning-CNN-Cat-Dog-Image-Classifier
This repository contains my independent work for the [second machine learning project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/cat-and-dog-image-classifier) as part of the freeCodeCamp [Machine Learning with Python course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/). Using Python, Keras, and TensorFlow, I constructed a binary image classifier for cats and dogs by employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. This was created in a Jupyter notebook, edited in Google's Colab environment and includes in-depth explanations of the problem solving approaches used. This imports a dataset, converts images into tensors, and partitions them into training, validation, and test sets. Data augmentation was applied to the test set, and the modelâ€™s CNN architecture was initialised. The neural network was trained and validated on two datasets, using 15 epochs, resulting in an accuracy exceeding 63% on a final test batch of 50 images.
